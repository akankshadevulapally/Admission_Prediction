# Admission_Prediction


â€¢	Led the 'Admission Prediction' project, employing ML techniques like MLR and RFR to predict graduate admissions by optimizing model performance. Implemented PCA for feature projection, achieving nearly 89% accuracy and visualizing model performance effectively. 
Demonstrated proficiency in Machine Learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, showcasing the ability to minimize MSE and RMSE, maximize R-Square scores,
and extract key features using PCA for enhanced predictions.![image](https://github.com/akankshadevulapally/Admission_Prediction/assets/53175233/946abc3b-50e5-4c05-bd76-2c151bd37a30)
